![Design preview for the Recipe page coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out my solution to the [Recipe Page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). This was a great experience to work with only HTML5 and CSS on a realistic project.

## Overview

### The Challenge

The objective of this challenge was to build out a recipe page that closely matches the provided design. This required careful attention to details in layout, styling, and typography, using only HTML and CSS.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I Learned

This project taught me some new CSS properties that were key in achieving the design. Despite facing a delay due to an eye infection, I enjoyed experimenting with layout and structure. Hereâ€™s an example snippet that Iâ€™m proud of:

```html
<h1>Omelete Recipe</h1>
```

```css
.recipe-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
}
```

Completing this project strengthened my understanding of CSS layout techniques and custom properties. 

### Continued Development

For future projects, I plan to delve deeper into responsive design and refine my use of CSS grid and flexbox to improve layouts.
