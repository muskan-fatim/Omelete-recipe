# Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Solution

This is my solution to the [Recipe Page Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). Frontend Mentor challenges are great for improving coding skills through realistic projects. This was my first challenge on the platform, and I faced a few delays due to an eye infection, but I’m happy with the outcome.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I Learned

This project taught me some new CSS properties, which I enjoyed implementing. Here’s a snippet of code that I’m proud of:

```html
<h1>Omelete Recipe</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

I learned a lot by experimenting and building this page from scratch with HTML5 and CSS, focusing on best practices with only these two technologies.

### Continued Development

Going forward, I plan to explore more CSS techniques to refine my layouts. I’ll also aim to improve responsiveness and styling to create visually engaging pages.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This website is packed with tips that really helped with specific styling issues.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - An amazing resource for understanding CSS properties in depth.
